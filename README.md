🏋️ Fitness Recommendation System – Microservices Architecture
📌 Project Overview

The Fitness Recommendation System is a backend-focused application built using Java and Spring Boot, designed to provide personalized fitness recommendations based on user activity data and preferences. The system follows a microservices architecture to ensure scalability, modularity, and maintainability.

🧩 Microservices Architecture

The application is divided into multiple independent services:

User Service – Manages user profiles, authentication, and preferences

Activity Service – Handles user fitness activities and workout data

Recommendation Service – Generates personalized fitness recommendations based on activity patterns

Eureka Server – Provides service discovery for dynamic microservice communication

Kafka – Enables asynchronous, event-driven communication between services

🔐 Security

Implemented JWT-based authentication

Applied OAuth2 concepts for securing REST APIs

Role-based access control for protected endpoints
